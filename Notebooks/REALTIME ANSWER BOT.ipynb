      "2. **Mathematical Function (Composite Number)**: A composite number is a function that determines if a number is divisible by another number other than by itself and one. For example, the number (3×5×13×46)+23 is a composite number because it is divisible by 23.\n",

For example, in a game where numbers are added together (e.g., AWXBYZ and WAXBYZ), the total number of turns can be calculated as 3 * (24 * 23 * 22 * 21), and TREE(3) is the longest possible number of turns in such a game.\n"

    "**RBI Cyber Security Framework: Baseline Requirements for Banks**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a cyber security expert, I will outline the specific baseline requirements mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for banks to ensure robust cyber security and resilience. These requirements are designed to safeguard customer data, systems, and digital payment transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documented Baseline Security Configurations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks are required to document and apply baseline security configurations to all categories of devices, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **End-points/Workstations**: Ensure that all end-points/workstations have the latest operating system, security patches, and antivirus software installed.\n",
    "2. **Mobile Devices**: Implement mobile device management (MDM) solutions to secure mobile devices, including encryption, remote wipe, and password policies.\n",
    "3. **Network Devices**: Configure network devices, such as firewalls, routers, and switches, to ensure secure communication and segmentation.\n",
    "4. **Database Management Systems**: Implement database encryption, access controls, and backup procedures to protect sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Baseline Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The RBI has listed 24 requirements to achieve baseline cyber security and resilience, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, and segregation of duties.\n",
    "2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.\n",
    "3. **Network Segmentation**: Segment the network to limit lateral movement in case of a breach.\n",
    "4. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems**: Implement IDS/IPS systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\n",
    "5. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate weaknesses.\n",
    "6. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and implement an incident response plan to respond to security incidents.\n",
    "7. **Cyber Crisis Management Plan**: Establish a cyber crisis management plan to manage and respond to cyber crises.\n",
    "8. **Security Awareness Training**: Provide regular security awareness training to employees to educate them on cyber security best practices.\n",
    "9. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.\n",
    "10. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Implement a SIEM system to monitor and analyze security-related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The RBI's Cyber Security Framework provides a robust roadmap for banks to protect customer data and systems from cyber threats. By implementing these baseline requirements, banks can ensure robust cyber security and resilience, reducing the risk of cyber attacks and protecting customer trust. As a cyber security expert, I recommend that banks prioritize these requirements and invest in regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response planning to ensure long-term cyber security success."
